# Estimation of the pressure map of a human body on a mattress from infrared images
Despite the successes of deep neural networks in visual tasks, their application in practical medical settings remains limited. One of the persistent challenges is measuring the pressure of a human body on a mattress, crucial information for preventing pressure ulcers in patients hospitalized for extended periods. Traditional technologies, such as pressure sensors, have limitations such as cost and the need for calibration. In this context, we propose using infrared images to estimate the pressure map. This approach, involving the implementation of a UNET network and the use of the SLP (Simultaneously-collected multimodal Lying Pose) dataset for training, promises an effective and economical alternative for pressure monitoring in hospitalized patients.
